## Flowchart meta-model

Recreate the flowchart meta-model from the video lecture using the Ecore meta-model editor. Note that, different to the video, you won't have to create a new Ecore modelling project. Instead, import the `uk.ac.kcl.inf.mdd7.flowchart` project into your Eclipse and start editing the model by 

1. Changing to the modelling perpective
2. Opening the project, then navigating to `model/flowchart.ecore` and unfolding this in the model explorer.
3. You should see a blue-ish `flowchart` label underneath with an icon that looks a bit like a class diagram. Double click on this and the diagram should open.

Eventually, the autograding should pass and assign 50/50.
